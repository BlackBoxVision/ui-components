# UI components

This library contains the UI components that we use on our sites. These components use Material UI and are responsive to both desktop and mobile.

## Install

You can install this library via NPM or YARN.

### NPM

```bash
npm i @blackbox-vision/ui-components
```

### YARN

```bash
yarn add @blackbox-vision/ui-components
```

## Use case

In the beginnings, we develop some similar components that we use on our sites. Later, we ask ourselves: ¿Is necessary have all this duplicated code? ¿ Why not better make that all of this code be in an only place and use it? ¿Why not share it?
Well, here we are.
